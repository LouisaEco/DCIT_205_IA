## Challenges
She had a lot of chanllenges. One of her major challenge is color combination which she is really bad when it comes to that. She also have a problem with contrast that is for the it to be clear and did not know the name for accordion but was so interested to include it.


## Lessons from the project.
Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience in:
Front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Responsive design principles that is making sure there is a contract on my page.
Integrating interactive features, such as an accordion for course details.
Implementing a contact form for user interaction.
Version control and collaboration using Git and GitHub.
I look forward to incorporating feedback and continually improving the website to meet the evolving needs of the Department of Computer Science.
